Review: I will be able to tell you more in a few years, but it looks really good since I installed it. It was easy to install. I had no problems. At the Home Depot store the employees were eager to load it for me. I am 76 and not as strong as i used to be. It was boxed very well and I was able to slide it down the stairs with ease. The hookup was easy. Every thing fit. It was easy to start as it has an elect. start button for ignition. (no more matches). The water temperature is easy to see and it has a light indicating operational condition so you know everthing is working as it should. A great improvement!

Review: It's a water heater, plain and simple. I bought it to replace a 17 year old unit in the attic. It was heavy as sin to get into the attic through the ceiling access door, but that's the price we pay for putting them in the attic here in the south. Once up there, the assembly is straight forward and easy to complete. Anyone with basic knowledge of threaded fittings and PVC fittings can do all the basic assembly of the hold/cold supply lines and overflow piping.
It was a little hard to start, which worried me, but I kept trying and sure enough, the little blue light started flashing as described in the owners manual. No telling how long it sat at Home Depot waiting for a home.
It is currently on the lowest setting and hot water is delivered quickly.

It has only been working for us for about a month, but so far so good.
Why did I buy a Rheem? Price, quality, good reviews, fit into the attic.
Would I buy another Rheem? Absolutely.

Review: Yesterday morning I purchased this water heater without any reservations. I installed it myself & a buddy. We took a long time to get my old 20yr old heater, drained, disconnected, and removed. We installed the Reheem with a lot of tweeking ( cutting/sodering) but eventually it was all connected, pilot light igniting system worked flawlessly. I am extremely pleased with this heater, the water is hot!
My wife is happy, I'm happy. Thank you Home Depot & thank you Reheem !!

Review: Purchased this water heater from my local Home Depot this morning at 10:30am. Get it installed and filled up by 5pm only to have a code pop up that the control valve is defective. Because Rheem is an East coast company I cannot call them to trouble shoot. Home Depot will not assist with out a return confirmation from Rheem. It is really disappointing to spend your hard earned money and time to install something that was defective out of the box. Even though my old heater was leaking at least it was working. If I cannot get it to work I will be returning the product and going to Sears like many suggested for a quality brand product. I will now be without hot water for a few days....online trouble shooting guide is of no help as well. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.

Review: If you happen to be one of the ones that gets a good heater then you will probably be fine, if however you are one of the unlucky ones like myself that gets stuck with a defective heater, GOOD LUCK. This company (Rheem) has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. They don't back up their products at all. My heater's pilot shuts off by itself at random times. Out of nowhere we are out of hot water. Rheems website doesn't even list a phone number for warranty, service or any type of customer service. It only offers a list of local plumbers. They list an email but I never received a reply back from them. After diligent research I found a phone number for Canada residents and called it and it gave me a US tech support number. Spoke to a rep and they said that I needed to get my gas company to do a gas pressure check. I did that and pressure was fine. Called Rheem back and this time was literally told my water heater was fine and that the pilot shutting off n leaving me without hot water was perfectly normal. Happens to everybody with a water heater and there's nothing they can do about it! PLEASE BUY ANOTHER BRAND BUT RHEEM.

Review: Installed on copper water lines. Home Depot associate recommended their Shark Bite fittings instead of the 3/4 copper pipe and associated fittings I had in my cart. All said and done, the shark bite fittings were cheaper than the copper and the installation quite literally took 10 minutes. Cut the water lines, push the Shark Bites onto the copper pipes. Move the gas line over to the new unit. Done.

Easiest install ever. Pilot light has a piezo igniter on it, so it's a snap to light. Had hot water in no time. Even got a nice rebate from the gas company. Couldn't have been any more painless.

Review: The 1st water heater I got was defected, I had to pay the plumber to install then uninstall the reinstall. I called the Manufacturer Rheem but they were closed, I then called the store I purchased it from and was told to bring it back, when I talked with the manufacturer the next day to get reimbursed for the plumber cost I was told Home Depot should never have taken the product back and should have told me to contact the manufacture and they would of sent someone out and I wouldn't have have to pay the extra money to the plumber. The 2nd heater worked just fine, I was just out an extra $250.00 dollars.

Review: Very pleased with this water heater. Ordered over the 'net, and picked up in store. I like the convenience of doing the product research in the comfort of my home and taking as long as necessary to ensure I get the product I need. When I arrived at the store, the item was waiting for pickup at the customer service counter - and since it was pre-paid, I was in and out of the store quickly. Self-installed, and it's working very well so far. The only thing wrong with this purchase was that the water heater didn't come with any instructions nor paperwork. I wondered if it was lost somewhere along the way.

Review: Picked this unit up at the local Home Depot to replace an old HWH that started leaking badly. It seemed to have all the same features and capabilities of many of the much more expensive models sold elsewhere but with a brand name I'd actually heard before. So I figured I'd give it a try. Got it installed and during the leak test it immediately started leaking gas from the regulator. I disconnected it took it back to Home Depot expecting an argument over exchanging it for a new one but they were surprisingly nice about it and immediately let me exchange it for a new one. Maybe it was because it had only been a couple hours since I bought it or maybe Home Depot just stepped up their customer service. I won't speculate it worked out. The second one went in no leaks no problems. I'll update this once I have had it a while and I either do or don't have the same issues that some of the others have had on here. Installed in a basement no moisture issues.

Review: Based solely on the measurements of the old unit I was replacing I purchased this hot water tank. I looked at tanks at sears, lowes, menards and HD. This was almost a perfect fit from the old heater. I purchased it online and when i went to get it - it was waiting at the front to pick up. The issue I have is with Rheem and HD. When I took it out of the box - the base of the unit was damaged - it had been dropped prior to being boxed up at the factory I assume. I would have returned it for a new one - but I had already transported it from HD - to home - to the basement and unboxed it. Something as heavy as this is not easy to just pick up and easily take back for an exchange. The unit installed great and works fine, the base is banged up. When I returned after the install to HD - to return a few parts I didnt need - I also asked about what HD would do about the dented base, and was told nothing, since it was not their fault, since the box was not dented, and only the HWH was dented, its a MFG issue. So Rheem - you may want to take some more time inspecting what you box up.

Review: Installed this heater in my mom's home. Installation was semi easy, being the old water heater was the same height. Just reattached the old vent with no modifications. Had to redue the relief line. The old heater had the P&T valve on the top of the tank. The new one came out of the side. Had only one setback. The P&T valve on the new heater was faulty and leaked after the water was turned on. I took out the P&T valve and brought it back to Home Depot. They just gave me a new one off the shelf. Installed it, everything was ok. I took a picture. I installed a insulating cover, even though installation instructions said it doesn't need one. And yes I made sure the insulating cover did not cover the combustion air intake on the heater.
Heater is working well and very quiet.

Review: This water heater was really easy to install. This is the tall unit as opposed to the short style. The hardest part of the project was getting the old one out of my basement. I like the auto start mechanism this unit has. No more fiddling with an extended lighter on my knees bending over to see the burner. This was much easier. Everything aligned with the old fittings so there was no need for creative installation. I used a liquid type thread sealer where previously I used yellow Teflon tape made for gas lines. SUPER EASY!

Review: This is a basic water heater for the simple purpose of heating and storing heated water. This heater is shorter and stouter than my previous Rheem water heater of the same volume, and it led to extra difficulty with the installation.The main thing the end user needs to do from time to time is adjust the temperature, but the makers of this heater, have made this a rather cumbersome task. The adjustment dial is tiny and has no precision. Turning it just the slightest amount takes you from Low temperature to High temperature. There is no graduating marks for any kind of fine adjustment. In fact the ‘play’ in the adjustment knob is about the same as the distance between the Low and High markings. This is 2015, not 1970! You’d think that Rheem would have by now included the ability for the user to easily adjust the temperature, such as by using a large knob with little ‘play’, markings that can be seen without a strong pair of glasses, and clickable settings. Whenever I see such a poorly designed mechanism on a product that’s been around forever, I think the design engineer along with the product development manager who approved it should be condemned to use that product for the rest of their lives.

Rheem customer service failed to log my call for service. no one showed up. No record of my call. POOR QUALITY. I installed a different brand the second time.

Review: I bought one in April at Home Depot. Pilot went out and would not relight in June, service company replaced electronic control. Since then it has failed 4 times. Able to relight after many tries. Get 7 blink error message about electronic gas control valve then it finally switches to normal 1 light. After going out the second time this week, I call plumber, they got it relit with same error message but called Rheem. Rheem says attic is too hot but won't say what too hot is. It is very hot up there on the last day of July in Houston, Tx. will be well over 100F.

Plumber says only solution is to deal with it or get an attic ventilation system installed...BY THE WAY, WE WILL GIVE YOU A QUOTE FOR FREE!.

Can I buy a different unit from you....no, Home Depot will find out and we will lose the install business.

Final words were that when it cools off, everything should be fine!

What a piece of junk.

Old water heater with mechanical controls and manual light lasted at least 15 years without a single problem.

Review: Bought this unit on Friday night to replace my old water heater. I couldn't get the unit to light. Called Rheem on Saturday morning who helped me diagnose the problem to a defective igniter. They promised to send it to me "next day". Turns out their parts dept doesn't work weekends/holidays. They sent out the part on Tuesday (4 days of no hot water). Plumber wouldn't schedule repair until the part arrived. When it came on Wednesday, the plumber said that Thursday was the earliest they could come. Rheem REFUSED to call the plumber. They offered to pay (up to a limit) if I had someone who could fix it! Really? I need to go find someone to fix my brand new defective water because the manufacturer has lousy customer service. The manager I spoke did not listen to my problem, she just kept repeating policy
Meanwhile, no hot water for a week..

Review: Installation was simple, however the pilot light will not function. Now I'm stuck waiting on a part that may or may not be the issue before a technician will even come out. We'll be without hot water for at least 48 hours.

Review: I was careful to select a unit with perfectly intact packaging but when opened a significant dent in the top of the housing indicated that it had been damaged before it had been packaged, so at the factory. Because of the excessive hassle of returning for an exchange I installed it anyway, I now second guess my decision as it may be a ticking time bomb when what ever internal damage might exist leads to failure. I should not be put in this position when buying a $400+ consumer item, I can't imagine the damage was not noticed by final QC but rather it was shipped anyway. The installation went fine, challenges were due to it being a couple inches taller than the unit it replaced so 50 year old steel plumbing needed to be worked with. I should be a fan of Rheem as the unit replaced was a 27 year old Rheem that only received standard preventative maintenance to serve that long, instead I will actively advise others to avoid the brand.

Review: My installer said the reason this was cheaper than the one he supplies was due to the fact that the gas housing is all now plastic and no longer brass like the good old days. We are all paying to get cheaper, but will the plastic become brittle over short time. Who knows?

Review: My plumber installed 2 of these the first one went out within a month,now the second one isn't working after 6 months and after numerous calls Rheem sent a tech out and just like dealing with Microsoft tech support ,he said it was the Gas Co problem. Yet the stove heater and gas dryer never stopped working.Now I got the teck coming back and the Gas Co who said there part is OK coming back today.
What a run around.
Do yourself a favor and get a different brand.

Review: The Hot Water Heater I purchased was recommended by the Sales Associate. I did not use a Home Depot installation person since I was able to get it installed by a man who has done other work in my house for me and his price was only $250 and that included hauling off the old hot water heater.

Review: So far so good.

The pilot lighting procedure and watching for a blinking blue light was a waste of time and effort.

Eventually, I removed the shield and used a mirror to see that the pilot light was burning.

Temperature control is very good. I set it near the vacation setting and still it gets me hot enough water in the winter. Don't want my kids to get burnt with hot water.

Review: Unit slid in right under old exhaust hood, and all fittings were very close to old gas and water pipes, so no additional changes were involved in installation.

Review: I own a small apartment building with 6 units. The original construction had State brand water heaters that started to fail at the 10 year mark. My maintenance guy recommended that we replace them with this model. I literally bought 6 of these with all the parts needed including pans and pumps. I cleaned out my local Home Depot that day of this model water heater LOL. It took us a weekend to replace everything and we got it done. No wasted trips and returning of parts neither. Simple and straight forward. My tenants are happy with the really hot water they now have.

Review: Installation was simple with average mechanical skill. One drawback is lack of clear instructions, you have to know a little about what your doing. Fortunately, there are general videos available on-line. Once installed, the unit fired up on the first try. The test now is whether the ease of installation translates into carefree operation in the long run with routine maintenance. Will report back as required or if no problems arise, I'll post to mention that when it proves itself. I would not hesitate to recommend this unit. Tidbits: Used Sharkbite supply lines to avoid soldering. Placed unit on a few bricks to raise height to old unit eliminating need to adjust exhaust.

Review: The relief valve location required modifications to the drain line that was routed to the top of the old heater. I suppose due to the slender and tall design of this water heater, the unit sits flush with the drip pan which was different from the old design with feet. This unit was easier to thread through an attic opening than the one it replaced.

Review: The heater had a dent in the rear of the unit when I opened the box which appears to be cosmetic (Rheem literature states do not return to place of purchase), The pressure relief valve could have been installed so it was plum not a 10 degree angle as my drain pipe would have came down in front of the tank drain. Seems to run fine other than those minor flaws

Review: It's only been up and running a few weeks, but this water heater is doing just what it's supposed to. With a little help from the internet, etc. I installed it myself and saved a good bit of money...not to mention this unit is a basic model at a lower price. I check it every so often to make sure all is well and so far it's fine. The control panel has a status light that tells you it's condition which is a nice feature. It seems well made and properly insulated; I've only noticed it actively heating once or twice. A good job done.
